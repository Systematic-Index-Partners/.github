# Systematic Index Partners

_Building markets through transparency._

## Overview

Systematic Index Partners (SIP Global) is a quantitative market infrastructure firm focused on underdeveloped physical markets.

We are market builders. SIP applies quantitative discipline and modern trading standards to physical assets where formal financial architecture has historically been absent. We build the systems that enable structured trading, including standardized contracts, transparent pricing methodologies, execution platforms, and operational frameworks, connected directly to centralized trading hubs, delivery networks, data pipelines, and settlement systems.

Our mission is to engineer the foundations of new markets, transforming fragmented and illiquid industries into structured, tradable ecosystems that generate durable liquidity and transparent price formation.
